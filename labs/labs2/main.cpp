 This program prompts the user to enter the radius of a circle.
 It then calculates and displays its area and circumference.
 
Algorithm steps:
1. Prompt user to enter radius of a circle and store the radius into a variable
2. Calculate area using the formula pi x radius x radius and store the value into a variable
3. Calculate circumference using the formula 2 x pi x radius and store the value into a variable
4. Output the calculated values for area and circumference
